### Basic CRUD with node mysql module

### Why not practice CRUD by

* `CREATE` table and `INSERT` your past ex lovers
* `READ` a list of ex lovers
* `UPDATE` table by adding more ex lovers
* `DELETE` by clicking `delete` button and execute query

I had lots of fun learning it, especially with `delete` button.
